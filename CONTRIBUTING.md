## You want to contribute some code?

We are always looking for quality contributions and will be happy to accept your Pull Requests as long as they adhere to some basic rules:

  * the only dependencies should be `react`, `prop-types` and `react-popper`
* Please assure that you are submitting quality code, specifically make sure that:
  * your code conforms to our set of eslint rules
  * your commits conform to the conventions established [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit#)
